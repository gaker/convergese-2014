Queries can get out of hand
===========================

Avoid queries in loops

<ul>
    <li class="fragment">
        Worst I've seen is 20k+ queries on a single page
    </li>
    <li class="fragment">
        Forcing JOINs with ``select_related()`` cut it down to 80 queries.
    </li>
    <li class="fragment">
        Start to get nervous when you're over 50 queries on a single page load.
    </li>
</ul>
